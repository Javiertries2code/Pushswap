 void sorting\+\_\+five(t\+\_\+list $\ast$$\ast$ends, int pv) // gotta check existance in case of \{//i gottapass pt\+\_\+lit pointers otherwise will fuckup later

listing and counting done

Sorting strategy

i cant start counting down from tail, as when rr, i will find those elements again

So, starting head \mbox{[}0\mbox{]} could be stored untill is reached, included as it could be higher than pv By now no need of hasssling too much with the optimization of moving both sides at the same time.

I created one struc data,to which every element will be pointing to, so as to collect info like pv, and so on

Goota check memory leaks again
