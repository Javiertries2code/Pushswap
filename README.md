listing and counting done

Sorting strategy

 i cant start counting down from tail, as when rr, i will find those elements again

 So, starting head [0] could be stored untill is reached, included as it could be higher than pv
 By now no need of hasssling too much with the optimization of moving both sides at the same time.

I created one struc data,to which every element will be pointing to, so as to collect info like pv, and so on


Goota check memory leaks again
