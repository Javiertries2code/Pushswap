# Pushswap
Test


All handlers working correctly
I added a printing function, also working ok
when calling print fun, after or before, i wshould FREE.

I freed numbers that is by now how i call the set of argv

i print errors, 

i checked if there are spaces in the argv, and split it, though it doesnt seems to be required

aint sure how its gonna work all togehter

The ATOI had to be changed to long long, to old a number that size in case of, to be free later

I dont know if i should free the argv once i aplit it :-( 

i DEFEINETELY NEED A MAKE FILE AND TO INTEGRATE DE LIBFT
